    abstract={Magnetic flow cytometers are promising tools to address cell detection and counting in a seamless and compact manner. Such devices integrate magnetic sensors with microfluidics for sample transportation and magnetic particles as reporters. This work presents a signal analysis method developed to address one of the challenges in magnetic flow cytometry: the ability to distinguish signatures of free or clustered magnetic particles from magnetically labelled targets. Comparing the sensor output signals (pulse amplitude vs. pulse width analysis) with simulations we develop a reliable classification methodology for labelled targets based on a custom Matlab algorithm. Upon discrimination of different signatures for clusters or single particles, one can reduce the number of false positives while improving the detection system accuracy.},

Giant magnetoresistive spin-valve (GMR SV) sensors coupled with magnetic nanotags (MNTs) possess great promise as ultra-sensitive biosensors for diagnostics. We report an integrated sensor interface for an array of 256 GMR SV biosensors designed in 0.18 μm CMOS.

They will soon allow more detailed mapping of neural structures than has ever before been possible, and capabilities for highly localized drug-delivery are being added for treating disorders such as severe epilepsy. For chronic neuroscience and neuroprosthesis applications, the arrays are being used in implantable microsystems that provide embedded signal processing and wireless data transmission to the outside world. A 64-channel microsystem amplifies the neural signals by 60 dB with a user-programmable bandwidth and an input-referred noise level of 8 $\mu{\hbox{V}}_{\rm rms}$ before processing the signals digitally. The channels can be scanned at a rate of 62.5 kS/s, and signals above a user-specified biphasic threshold are transmitted wirelessly to the external world at 2 Mbps. Individual channels can also be digitized and viewed externally at high resolution to examine spike waveforms. The microsystem dissipates 14.14 mW from 1.8 V and measures 1.4 $\times$ 1.55 cm  $^2$. },

The state of art of this measurement method has been improved first by separating the oscillator circuit from the sensing device, thus leading to higher linearity performance, and then by embedding a novel digital measurement control system. Measurements on a silicon prototype, designed in 0.35mum CMOS technology, show that the circuit achieves, without calibration, a precision in resistance measurement of about 0.4\% over a range of 4 decades and better than 0.8\% over 5 decades (dynamic range, DR=141dB). Furthermore, after calibration, it reaches a precision of 0.4\% ranging in [1kOmega-1GOmega], thus leading to a DR of 166dB. Finally, in fast-mode, the circuit achieves an accuracy of 0.2\% over 2 decades on a single scale with a throughput higher than 100Hz consuming 15mW from 3.3V supply},

Resistance-to-Period converter, used as interface, is preferred if the resistance variations are very large. This paper presents the structure of an interface circuit for resistive sensors that is highly robust to component and power supply variations. Robustness is achieved by using the ratiometric approach, thus complex circuits or highly accurate voltage references are not necessary. To validate the proposed approach, a prototype was implemented using discrete components. Measurements were carried out considering a variation of &plusmn;35% in the single supply voltage and a range from 1 k   &Omega;    to 1 M   &Omega;   .},

As the magnetic beads are superparamagnetic, commercial permanent magnets (PMs) are typiacally positioned bellow the microchip for an out-of-plane magnetization. Though, they require careful alignment as their magnetic field can impact the sensors sensitivity. In this paper, we overcome this drawback by presenting an innovative custom-made PM that notably combines high out-of-plane magnetic field (>100 mT) and low in-plane magnetic field (<;1mT) over a large area (30.2mm2). This configuration qualifies the setup for simultaneous detection in multiple microfluidic channels within the same microchip, allowing parallel analysis of different cell samples or faster analysis of larger volumes of cell suspension.},

    abstract = {GMR sensors are widely used in many industrial segments such as information technology, automotive, automation and production, and safety applications. Each area requires an adaption of the sensor arrangement in terms of size adaption and alignment with respect to the field source involved. This paper deals with an analysis of geometric sensor parameters and the arrangement of GMR sensors providing a design roadmap for non-destructive testing (NDT) applications. For this purpose we use an analytical model simulating the magnetic flux leakage (MFL) distribution of surface breaking defects and investigate the flux leakage signal as a function of various sensor parameters. Our calculations show both the influence of sensor length and height and that when detecting the magnetic flux leakage of µm sized defects a gradiometer base line of 250 µm leads to a signal strength loss of less than 10\% in comparison with a magnetometer response. To validate the simulation results we finally performed measurements with a GMR magnetometer sensor on a test plate with artificial µm-range cracks. The differences between simulation and measurement are below 6\%. We report on the routes for a GMR gradiometer design as a basis for the fabrication of NDT-adapted sensor arrays. The results are also helpful for the use of GMR in other application when it comes to measure positions, lengths, angles or electrical currents.},

    abstract = {Although conventional state-of-the-art flow cytometry systems provide rapid and reliable analytical capacities{,} they are bulky{,} expensive and complex. To overcome these drawbacks modern flow cytometers have been developed with enhanced portability for on-site measurements. Unlike external fluorescent/optical detectors{,} magnetoresistive sensors are micro-fabricated{,} can be integrated within microfluidic channels{,} and can detect magnetically labelled cells. This work describes the real-time detection of single magnetically labelled cells with a magnetoresistive based cell cytometer. For Kg1-a cells magnetically labelled with 50 nm CD34 microbeads (Milteny) flowing through a 150 μm wide{,} 14 μm high microchannel{,} with speeds around 1 cm s−1{,} bipolar signals with an average amplitude of 10–20 μV were observed corresponding to cell events. The number of cells counted by the spin valve cytometer has been compared with that obtained with a hemocytometer. Both methods agree within the respective error bars.}

    abstract = {This paper presents a prototype of a platform for biomolecular recognition detection. The system is based on a magnetoresistive biochip that performs biorecognition assays by detecting magnetically tagged targets. All the electronic circuitry for addressing, driving and reading out signals from spin-valve or magnetic tunnel junctions sensors is implemented using off-the-shelf components. Taking advantage of digital signal processing techniques, the acquired signals are processed in real time and transmitted to a digital analyzer that enables the user to control and follow the experiment through a graphical user interface. The developed platform is portable and capable of operating autonomously for nearly eight hours. Experimental results show that the noise level of the described platform is one order of magnitude lower than the one presented by the previously used measurement set-up. Experimental results also show that this device is able to detect magnetic nanoparticles with a diameter of 250 nm at a concentration of about 40 fM. Finally, the biomolecular recognition detection capabilities of the platform are demonstrated by performing a hybridization assay using complementary and non-complementary probes and a magnetically tagged 20mer single stranded DNA target.},

	abstract = {One hundred and one years after J J Thomson was awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the electron, the 2007 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Professors Peter Grünberg and Albert Fert for the discovery of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) in which the spin as well as the charge of the electron is manipulated and exploited in nanoscale magnetic materials. The journey to GMR started with Lord Kelvin who 150 years ago in 1857 made the first observations of anisotropic magnetoresistance and includes Sir Neville Mott who in 1936 realized that electric current in metals could be considered as two independent spin channels. Modern technology also has a significant role to play in the award of this Nobel Prize: GMR is only manifest in nanoscale materials, and the development of nanotechnology growth techniques was a necessary pre-requisite; further, the considerable demands of the magnetic data storage industry to drive up the data density stored on a hard disk fuelled an enormous international research effort following the initial discovery with the result that more than 5 billion GMR read heads have been manufactured since 1997, ubiquitous in hard disks today. This technology drive continues to inspire exploration of the spin current in the field now known as spintronics, generating new ideas and applications. This review explores the science underpinning GMR and spintronics, the different routes to its discovery taken by Professors Grünberg and Fert, the new science, materials and applications that the discovery has triggered and the considerable potential for the future.}

The sensor noise level in quasi-DC or high-frequency applications is described, leading to sensor design considerations concerning biomedical and read head applications. Magnetic tunnel junction based sensors using MgO barriers appear as the best candidates for ultra-low field (pT) detection, either in the high-frequency regime, or for quasi-DC applications.}

@article{Soares2019,
   abstract = {The growing need for biological information at the single cell level has driven the development of improved cytometry technologies. Flow cytometry is a particularly powerful method that has evolved over the past few decades. Flow cytometers have become essential instruments in biomedical research and routine clinical tests for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. However, the increasing number of cellular parameters unveiled by genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data platforms demands an augmented multiplexability. Also, the need for identification and quantification of relevant biomarkers at low levels requires outstanding analytical sensitivity and reliability. In addition, growing awareness of the advantages associated with miniaturization of analytical devices is pushing forward the progress in integrated and compact, microfluidic-based devices at the point-of-care. In this context, novel types of flow cytometers are emerging during the search to tackle these challenges. Notwithstanding the relevance of other promising alternatives to standard optical flow cytometry (e.g., mass cytometry, various optical and electrical microcytometers), this report focuses on a recent microcytometric technology based on magnetic sensors and magnetic particles integrated into microfluidic structures for dynamic bioanalysis of fluid samples—magnetic flow cytometry. Its concept, main developments, targeted applications, as well as the challenges and trends behind this technology are presented and discussed. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},
